Early this week, Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin made a surprise visit to Suvarnabhumi airport and instructed officials to speed up immigration and baggage claim procedures for travelers. AOT Director Kirati Kijmanawat said on Feb. 6 that the number of passengers flying into Thailand is expected to jump by 206%, compared to the same period last year, as the country has now fully reopened to foreign visitors. He said the government's visa-free policy for tourists from countries has given the industry a much-needed boost. Thailand is applying visa exemption for visitors from Kazakhstan and China for 30-day stay until Feb. 29. Russian passport holders can stay in Thailand for 90 days until April 30, while Indian and Taiwanese tourists also enjoy a 30-day stay until May 10. Recently, Thailand and China signed an agreement on a reciprocal visa-free scheme that will take effect from March 1. Under the agreement, holders of valid, ordinary Thai passports and Chinese holders of passports for public affairs and ordinary passports will be exempt from visa requirements for entering, exiting or transiting the other country for up to 30 days. Kirati also said that self-check-in kiosks had been installed at AOT's six international airports \u2013 Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang, Phuket, Chiang Mai, Hat Yai and Chiang Rai \u2013 so that passengers can check in up to six hours in advance.

Jellied pork is a popular dish enjoyed in colder months in northern Vietnam. Traditionally served cold, the origins of this dish are often associated with the idea of unintentionally leaving a stewed pork leg outside in the cold. This recipe serves about 6 to 8 people, takes approximately 70 minutes to prepare, and provides around 2,970 calories in total. Ingredients: - 1 kilogram of deboned pork leg meat - 300 grams of pork skin - 100 grams of wood ear mushrooms - Spices: salt, fish sauce, pepper, MSG (optional), shallots Instructions 1. Preparation - Choose deboned pork leg with a tender texture. Depending on your taste, you can include pork ears, tongue, and nose. - Remove any hair on the skin, then rub with salt and wash. The collagen in the pork skin turns the pork mixture into a jelly-like consistency as it cools. However, be careful not to add too much pork skin to avoid the jellied pork becoming too tough. - Submerge pork leg meat and skin in enough cold water to cover them. It's advised to avoid placing the meat and skin directly into boiling water initially to prevent impurities from being trapped in them. - Add a pinch of salt and crushed shallots to eliminate odors. - Bring the pot to a boil and let the meat and skin cook for about 5 minutes. - After boiling, remove and rinse the meat and skin until clean. - Cut them into bite-sized pieces. - Marinate the meat and skin with a teaspoon of salt, fish sauce. - Soak wood ear mushrooms in water, clean, and cut into long strips. - Marinate the mushrooms with a teaspoon of fish sauce and pepper. - Over time, variations have emerged, including the addition of carrots and shiitake mushrooms. Feel free to include these ingredients based on your preference. 2. Cooking process - In a hot pan, fry shallots in oil until fragrant. - Remove the shallots once cooked and stir-fry the meat in the same oil until it firms up. - Add hot water, bring to a boil, then simmer on low heat. - Optionally, you can skip stir-frying the meat to preserve its pure flavors. - Maintain a low simmer and leave the lid slightly open to let steam out, avoiding too much heat. High heat may break down collagen, leading to a cloudy broth. - Allow the meat and skin to simmer for 50 to 60 minutes. During this time, collagen in the skin gradually transforms into gelatin. This gelatin, when cooled, solidifies the broth, giving it a consistency similar to jelly. - Add wood ear mushrooms, cook over low heat for 6-8 minutes, season with fish sauce and optional MSG. - Remove the skin if not preferred. - After cooking, transfer the meat into individual serving bowls. Optionally, sprinkle the mixture with some pepper. - Cool the meat in the refrigerator to achieve a jelly-like consistency. In the past, people would wait for the temperature to drop and place the meat bowl outside to cool. - When serving, gently shake the bowl and place it face down on a plate to release the jellied pork. 3. Final product - The jellied pork bowl should be clear, with soft meat and a slowly dissolving jelly-like broth when eaten. - This dish is often served along with a bowl of chillies fish sauce and pickled scallion heads (cu kieu).", "date": "2024-02-15 23:53:18"}, {"url": "https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/foreign-tourists-receive-lucky-money-make-vietnamese-tet-cakes-4710520.html?vn_source=Folder&vn_campaign=Stream&vn_medium=Item-24&vn_term=Desktop", "title": "Foreign tourists receive lucky money, make Vietnamese Tet cakes", "content": "Vietnam tours are offering international visitors the opportunity to make their own Tet sticky rice cakes, receive lucky money and enjoy other holiday staples, according to travel agents and resorts.

Vu Dai Village's braised fish in Ha Nam Province is a cherished specialty for reunions and festive occasions. The village often makes the dish in large number for sale ahead of the Lunar New Year (Tet) holiday. It is bought by Vietnamese across the country as a holiday specialty, and is also exported. This recipe serves about 4 to 5 people, takes approximately 3 to 4 hours to prepare, and provides around 2,200 calories in total. Ingredients - 800 - 900 grams of black carp - 200 grams of pork belly - 45 ml of fermented crab paste - Galangal, ginger, scallions, chili - Fish sauce, salt, sugar, stock powder, MSG, pepper, lime Instructions 1. Preparation a. Prepare the fish - Remove scales, gut and clean the fish thoroughly. - Rub the fish with salt and lemon to eliminate any undesirable odor. Several methods exist to eliminate the fishy odor when preparing fish, including rubbing with lime and salt, washing with rice water, using wine, and incorporating crushed ginger. - It is recommended to rub the fish again with a bit of sea salt to enhance the fish's firmness and flavor. The technique is mentioned as a secret used by the people of Vu Dai Village. b. Prepare fermented crab paste - After cleaning the crabs, manually pound them and filter to extract the juice. - Mix the juice with salt, thinh - powdered grilled rice, galangal, dried kumquat skins, and shallots, then transfer the blend into a sealed ceramic jar, placing it next to a wood stove. - Allow the mixture to ferment for approximately 7 days, during which time it develops a characteristic aroma. The longer the crab sauce is stored, the more fragrant and delightful it becomes. c. Prepare the spices - Slice half of the galangal to line the pot's bottom, and pound the remaining half for marinade. - Wash the ginger and slice it. - Extract the lime juice, a crucial component for removing any fishy odor and ensuring the tenderness of the braised fish, even its bones. 2. Marinade - Combine the following ingredients to season the fish: Ground galangal Scallions 3 tablespoons of fermented crab paste (45 ml) 2 tablespoons of fish sauce 2 to 3 tablespoons of caramel sauce 2 tablespoons of lime juice 2 teaspoons of sugar 1 teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of pepper 1/2 teaspoon of MSG or stock powder - Ensure thorough mixing and allow the fish to marinate for a minimum of 30 minutes to absorb the flavors. - For enhanced taste, a longer marinade time is recommended, especially if braising for an extended period. 3. Cooking process The distinctive aspect of Vu Dai Village's braised fish lies in the specific cooking equipment used: a clay pot with a lid, and longan wood. The pot should be cured by boiling in hot water for durability. The preparation is intricate, taking up to 12 hours to achieve firm, soft, flavorful fish pieces that are edible, even with bones. While these tools might not be readily available, you can recreate this recipe at home using standard cooking equipment by following the process: - To ensure the fish doesn't stick to the pot, line the bottom with galangal and ginger before placing the fish on top. For larger quantities, alternate layers of fish and crushed galangal for easy serving. - Meat is added later for a rich taste while keeping the pieces intact. When preparing the braised fish at home, the dish can undergo a double cooking process to closely emulate the traditional taste. a. First braising: - Boil the fish pot on high heat for 3-4 minutes to allow the fish to absorb flavor. - Add boiling water until the sauce evenly covers the fish's surface. It's crucial to use boiling water to prevent any fishy scent. - Reduce heat to low, open the lid, and simmer, seasoning accordingly. - After 40 - 45 minutes, turn off the stove, allowing the fish meat to become more firm. b. Second braising: - Heat the fish over low heat. - Add pork belly, occasionally tilting or using a spoon to distribute the stock evenly. - When the stock is almost gone, leaving 1/3 in the pot, add old boiling water to continue braising. - Braise the fish for 2 - 3 hours or longer if desiring softer bones. - Finish by sprinkling a little lard for shine and a beautiful color. Finished product: - The braised fish boasts vibrant colors and enticing aromas, with firm meat, edible bones, and the delightful fragrance of galangal.", "date": "2024-02-15 23:53:18"}, {"url": "https://e.vnexpress.net/news/places/phu-quoc-welcomes-1000-thai-tourists-on-5-star-cruise-ship-for-first-time-4708096.html?vn_source=Folder&vn_campaign=Stream&vn_medium=Item-62&vn_term=Desktop", "title": "Phu Quoc welcomes 1,000 Thai tourists on 5-star cruise ship for first time", "content": "The Italy-flagged Costa Serena cruise ship carrying over 1,000 tourists from Thailand docked at Duong Dong Port in the southern island of Phu Quoc on Friday.

Park's work boasts nearly 400,000 likes on his TikTok channel and a YouTube channel with over 150,000 followers. Having spent 15 years in Ho Chi Minh City, he is not only fluent in Vietnamese, but also harbors a deep passion for Vietnamese cuisine. In fact, he even ventured into the culinary realm by opening a Vietnamese restaurant in central Seoul, South Korea. Driven by his love for the culture of Vietnam, Park shares content on social media platforms in Vietnamese. His posts often explore Vietnamese food and dining customs. In a TikTok video posted at the close of 2023, Park delved into the customs Vietnamese people employ when hosting guests for meals. Drawing from firsthand experience, he noted that Vietnamese are fond of inviting friends over, urging them to stay for dinner, and then serving an array of vastly diverse dishes. What intrigued him most was Vietnamese hosts' tendency to not just prepare a single dish, but to create a multi-faceted feast. In the video, Park captured the scene when a Vietnamese friend invited him to home to serve him a spread of dishes such as steamed sausage, fish soup, and duck. According to Park, Vietnamese find joy when their guests indulge heartily in the food served, but they also express disappointment when guests consume less. The video garnered nearly 1 million views, drawing attention from the Vietnamese online community, with many expressing interest in the Korean blogger's fluency in Vietnamese and his understanding of Vietnamese culture. The majority of comments aligned with Park's sentiment that Vietnamese people are exceptionally hospitable. One follower commented: \"When visiting a relative's house, if you decline an invitation to eat, the host might scold you, saying things like if you don't eat, you aren't really family.\" However, some Vietnamese viewers spotted a cultural oversight in the video when Park accidentally received the food from somebody else with his chopsticks during the meal. In Vietnamese culture, when receiving food from someone else, one must make sure to receive it directly in their bowl, avoiding the transfer of food between chopsticks. Avoiding this taboo is believed to steer one clear of potential bad luck. This isn't the first time the warmth of Vietnamese hospitality has left an impression on foreign writers. Matthew Pike, a blogger, and Culture Trip travel site reporter who also once resided in Saigon, expressed his admiration for Vietnamese people, emphasizing their hospitality in an article. \"It's quite usual to witness groups of tourists being welcomed into local homes for a meal. Particularly during festivals, you might be treated to local cuisine and revel in festivities until the late hours. This is an aspect of Vietnamese culture that never fails to leave a positive impression on international tourists,\" according to Pike.", "date": "2024-02-15 23:53:18"}, {"url": "https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/nearly-300-taiwanese-tourists-stranded-in-vietnam-as-tour-company-defaults-on-payment-4711430.html?vn_source=Folder&vn_campaign=Stream&vn_medium=Item-12&vn_term=Desktop", "title": "Nearly 300 Taiwanese tourists stranded in Vietnam as tour company defaults on payment", "content": "The failure by a Taiwanese tour company to pay its Vietnamese partner has left 292 of the former\u2019s clients stranded on Phu Quoc Island.

Hoang Tuan Minh, director of local travel agency Winner Vietnam, which was to provide them with services, told VnExpress that the Taiwanese partner had agreed to make full payment by Jan 31. But it failed and so he had canceled the contract, he said. But the Taiwanese company went ahead and sent the group to Phu Quoc, where there were no vehicles and hotels or waiting for them. It contacted Minh and pleaded with him to take care of the visitors. He agreed for \"humanitarian\" reasons and sent 18 buses and Chinese-speaking guides to Phu Quoc airport and lodged the visitors at two five-star hotels. The Taiwanese company had promised to pay on Feb 11. But it again failed to pay, and Minh informed the company that he would no longer serve the tourists. He had spent billions of dong (VND1 billion = US$40,700) already.

Hoang Van Thuy, manager of GreenLines DP Company, said many potential customers had called his company asking about Tet fireworks cruise tours, but very few had actually made reservations. GreenLines currently has two yachts that can accommodate 12-20 people, with prices ranging from VND15-20 million (US$616-821) each per cruise. Lieu Thi My Hanh, CEO of Les Rives Company, said her company has three yachts and 14 other boats providing tours along the Saigon River. It offers a cruise tour that allows guests to watch fireworks on Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve and enjoy the city nightlife, combined with light meals. The tour departs at 10 p.m. on Feb. 9 and ends at 1 a.m. the next day with tickets costing VND4 million per person. Hanh said that although Tet is approaching, the number of tourists registering for cruise tours on Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve has decreased by half compared to the Gregorian New Year holiday. Tour purchasing power has decreased because many tourists prefer traveling to other parts of the country due to long vacation, she added. Hanh also said that her major customer bases of overseas Vietnamese and foreigners living and working in Vietnam often return home to visit family during Tet, leading to a significant decrease in sales at her company. During this year\u2019s Gregorian New Year holiday, her two yachts, each with a capacity of 40 guests, were completely booked. King Yatch cruises also offer a tour program for VND1.7 million per adult and VND1.2 million for children that still has plenty of spaces available for Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve.

Nguyen Kim Toan, director of a travel company which runs the double-decker river bus tour, said his number of booking on Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve is so far also lower than the New Year's Eve. He posited that in addition to visiting their families, many potential customers were also traveling to more popular tourist destinations for the holiday instead. According to statistics from the travel platform Mustgo, downtown HCMC\u2019s 5-star hotels with the best views for the fireworks still have many vacant rooms for this upcoming Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve.

Today, demand for Dong Tao chicken, whose meat has a crunchy texture, a distinct fragrant aroma and a rich flavor, has risen sharply, backed by a growing number of wealthy people in one of Asia's fastest-growing economies. \"A fully grown dragon chicken of at least one year old farmed in Dong Tao village is sold for up to 5 million dong ($205.38) or sometimes even 10 million dong,\" said Le Trong Dung, a chicken farmer in the village.

Lemongrass chicken, chicken curry, shredded chicken salad, and boiled chicken were 36th, 39th, 57th, and 60th. Lemongrass chicken, a much beloved dish in the Mekong Delta, is made by marinating the meat in a mixture of lemongrass, chili, shallot, garlic, sugar, salt, oil, turmeric powder, and fish sauce. The chicken is then stir-fried and simmered until tender, and usually served with hot rice or noodles. Vietnamese chicken curry is an adaptation of the Indian variety, and the meat is cooked with potato, carrot, onion, garlic, coconut milk, chicken broth, and flavoring like lemongrass, fish sauce, bay leaf, and curry powder. It is served with white rice or bread. Shredded chicken salad is a blend of sweet, savory, crunchy and tangy ingredients like boiled chicken, carrot, onion, cilantro, mint, and, occasionally, cabbage. The ingredients are mixed in a bowl and dressed with a mixture of lime juice, fish sauce, chili, garlic, and sugar. It is garnished with roasted peanuts and crispy fried shallot before serving. Boiled chicken, a traditional Chinese dish, has gained popularity in northern Vietnam, especially during the Lunar New Year, symbolizing abundance and prosperity. It involves cooking a whole chicken with ginger, salt, scallion, and turmeric powder, giving it a golden appearance. After boiling, the chicken is cooled in ice water to halt the cooking process and prevent darkening. The dish is often accompanied by a salt and lime dip and served with sticky rice.

From Jan. 19-23, Phu Quoc was chosen as the venue for the super wedding of a wealthy Indian couple. Although numbers were not specifically disclosed, a source told VnExpress said the amount of money they spent was \"really huge\" as the families rented an entire 5-star resort in the most expensive area of Phu Quoc Island, as well as the \"Kiss of The Sea\" floating stage located in waters just off the shore on the southern side of the island. The resort's room rates are up to VND160 million (US$6,538) per night, while the stage is capable of accommodating 5,000 seats, and the daily admission price is VND1 million per person. Huynh Quang Hung, chairman of Phu Quoc City People's Committee, said that weddings of the super-rich and influential international figures will create positive media effects on the island's tourism image. In the past year, the city also organized promotional programs in India to lure billionaires into holding their weddings there. \"In addition to India, we also aim to become a super wedding venue for billionaires from other countries,\" Hung said. He also revealed that Phu Quoc will soon host the super wedding of a billionaire from the United Arab Emirates after Lunar New Year holiday later this month. Phu Quoc is attractive to the wealthy and powerful due to its beautiful beaches, and the island resort destination boasts more than 30,000 hotel rooms, including 17,000 rooms at 5-star accommodation facilities. In Phu Quoc, billionaires can find unique tourism sites, such as Kiss Bridge, which recently gained international attention. In addition, in the Mediterranean Town area, fireworks displays last 7-10 minutes every night, while the southern tip of the island is home to big names in the global hospitality industry, which boast accommodation facilities of the highest class. John Paul Woolley, manager of JW Marriott Phu Quoc Emerald Bay Resort & Spa, said that in the past three months, the resort successfully hosted three \"super weddings\" for Indian couples. He said the facility has an experienced planning team that has honed their skills creating lavish, bespoke experiences for Indian customers. One of the important factors for a successful Indian \"super wedding\" is cuisine. Indian guests love food and have diverse dietary requirements, requiring chefs to build a special and rich menu. The complex\u2019s rare location in the Khem Beach area also brings visitors the romantic atmosphere of clear blue sea water and white sand beaches, Woolley said. \"Phu Quoc is emerging as an attractive beach tourism destination, completely different from other international destinations such as Bali, Phuket, and domestic cities such as Da Nang and Nha Trang,\" he said. Woolley said the Indian wedding tourism market will grow strongly in 2024. Hoang Anh, who participated in organizing two super weddings for Indian billionaires, said after choosing Phu Quoc as the venue to organize a super wedding, the bride and groom's families often cover the cost of the entire resort, including meals, and additional services for all members of the party and their guests. And what\u2019s more, guests often choose to travel and explore the island after the wedding ends. \"They really like Phu Quoc's specialties and often buy them as gifts,\" Hoang Anh said. However, he said Phu Quoc still has much to do to become a top wedding destination for the super-rich. Billionaire couples often request modern equipment and classic cars for their wedding, but Phu Quoc has very few providers of such services. Classic cars serving bridal processions are often brought in from Ho Chi Minh City, causing costs to increase. The increased amount of money sometimes make wedding organizers unhappy because Phu Quoc does not have enough professional services, Anh said. Vu Tien Van, chairman of the Board of Directors of Adavigo, a tourism unit specializing in the Phu Quoc market, also said that the billionaire wedding market is rich in potential but has not yet been realistically explored in Vietnam. Currently, Phu Quoc and other cities have only just laid the first bricks of this industry and there are still many difficulties ahead, Van said. Indian billionaire weddings could spark a travel fever for other Indian tourists. And this is the potential customer group that the Vietnamese tourism industry should target to avoid dependence on the Chinese market, he added.", "date": "2024-02-15 23:53:18"}, {"url": "https://e.vnexpress.net/news/places/where-to-watch-tet-fireworks-in-saigon-4710535.html?vn_source=Folder&vn_campaign=Stream&vn_medium=Item-30&vn_term=Desktop", "title": "Where to watch Tet fireworks in Saigon", "content": "Ho Chi Minh City has 11 locations with fireworks shows for Lunar New Year's Eve that will run for 15 minutes starting at 12 a.m. Saturday, and people can enjoy the shows from public places, cafes, or restaurants.

Many tourists are unfamiliar with the cultures of other countries, which can leave them in trouble while traveling abroad. Here are tips shared with VnExpress reader Trinh Hang, who has traveled to dozens of countries around the world. Self-discipline anywhere, anytime Some tourists only comply with regulations when there are traffic police, ticket checkers or security staff. Many countries around the world have minimized supervisors, replacing them with camera systems that tourists may not see. All illegal acts such as littering, breaking red lights, smoking in prohibited places, evading tickets at tourist attractions and writing graffiti on monuments can be recorded by camera footage. Therefore, it is best for you to voluntarily comply with the laws of the country where you are visiting. Get ready to line up Many tourists when traveling abroad are annoyed by having to queue to go to the restroom, buy food, or pay for tickets. Tourists sometimes have to queue for several hours to watch an art exhibition, or visit a UNESCO heritage site. In fact, queuing is a common civilized behavior around the world. The more popular the tourist attractions are, the more people will have to wait in line, and tourists should get used to it. Some places have a clever solution that allows visitors to enter directly without queuing, but they have to pay additional fees. Eat everything on your plate Ordering a lot of food and drink and then leaving massive leftovers is a bad habit for tourists. Food waste has become a top concern in many countries where wasting food can even incur official punishments. Some places even charge extra money for customers who leave food behind. Leaving leftover food not only makes other diners feel uncomfortable, but it can also hurt the chef, waiter, and restaurant owner. Be on time Many tourists have suffered delays or had their travel experiences canceled due to their own unpunctuality. When visiting a foreign country, there may be many unforeseen situations, so give yourself time to handle unwanted things. That way, you will always be on time no matter what happens. Respect common space While traveling abroad, tourists should limit making noise (including listening to music or talking) and reduce taking up space such as putting luggage on someone else's seat, and instruct accompanying children not to be mischievous. Especially in places with specific regulations on hours and dress codes, people should try to respect these rules. For example, in the train cabin, you should not turn on the lights after 10 p.m. While in the museum, you should not use flash when taking photos.

Phi Lieng Waterfall in Lam Dong Province Situated in Phi Lieng Commune, Dam Rong District, Lam Dong Province, Phi Lieng Waterfall is a destination 70 kilometers southwest of Da Lat city center and less than 290 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City. Phi Lieng is a waterfall that cascades through seven levels, with the main level towering over 100 meters in height. To reach the base of the waterfall, visitors need to traverse a dirt road, which can be challenging during the rainy season. However, at the beginning of the year, which is the dry season, traveling to the site becomes easier. Beginner trekkers are encouraged to select guided tours, which are available at prices starting from VND2 million ($81) per person. 5.

This dish has two names: gio xao (stir-fried pork roll) based on the preparation method and gio thu (pork head roll) based on the ingredients, primarily pork head meat like ears and cheeks. This recipe serves about 6 to 8 people, takes approximately 75 minutes to prepare, and provides around 3,000 calories in total. Ingredients - 1 pork ear (400 grams) - 500 grams pork cheek - 1/2 pork trotter (400 grams) - 30 grams of dried wood ear mushrooms - 2 shallots - Banana leaf or a stir-fried pork roll mold - Bamboo strings - Spices: fish sauce, MSG, crushed pepper, shallots Instruction 1. Preparation - Begin by thoroughly shaving the pork ear, pork cheek, and pork trotter. - Rub the cleaned pork ear, cheek and trotter with lime and salt, ensuring that any undesirable odors are minimized. - Rinse the meat thoroughly under running water. - Blanch the pork ear, cheek, and trotter with crushed shallot and salt. This process helps remove impurities and enhances the fragrance of the meat. - Thoroughly wash and drain the meat, then slice it thinly. - Combine all the sliced meat and marinate with 1.5 to 2 tablespoons of fish sauce, 3 teaspoons of crushed pepper, and 1 teaspoon of MSG. - Allow the meat to marinate for at least 30 minutes to infuse the flavors. - Soak wood ear mushrooms, wash, and cut into 0.5 cm thick pieces. 2. Cooking process - Heat a pan over medium heat and add shallots to it. - Then add the pork ear, cheek, and trotter to the pan with the shallots. - Stir-fry the meat for about 5 minutes over low heat to prevent sticking. - Once the meat firms up, increase the heat. - Stir well to drain any excess moisture or liquids from the ingredients. - Add the sliced wood ear mushrooms into the stir-fried mixture. - Stir the mixture for a few minutes, and adjust the seasoning to taste. - Continue stir-frying the pork mixture until the skin softens and begins to stick. - Allow the stir-fried meat to cool slightly before wrapping. This helps to release any excess heat, as meat that's too hot may spoil rapidly. On the other hand, if it becomes too cool, the mixture won't be sticky enough, which can make it difficult to shape into a firm roll. - Heat banana leaves over fire to enhance their flexibility and fragrance, then wash the banana leaves thoroughly. - Place a few layers of the prepared banana leaves on a flat surface. - Spoon the stir-fried meat onto the layered banana leaves. - Roll the banana leaves tightly around the meat, then secure the roll by tying them with bamboo strings. - After wrapping, press the roll with a heavy object to remove excess fat and ensure a compact shape. - During cold weather, the roll can be used after half a day of wrapping. - Alternatively, you can put the roll in the refrigerator to make it firm more quickly. - If available, you can opt for a pork roll mold, especially when making a large batch with limited banana leaves. - You can line the inside of the mold with heated banana leaves to impart the aroma to the stir-fried roll. - Transfer the stir-fried meat into the mold. Apply pressure using the handle to compact the mixture into the cylindrical shape. 3. Finished product - The stir-fried pork roll presents a well-defined shape, ensuring that each slice holds together in a clean cut - When eaten, one can savor the crunchy texture from the ear, the fattiness from the cheek, the fish sauce aroma, the spiciness from the pepper, and the subtle fragrance of banana leaves.", "date": "2024-02-15 23:53:18"}, {"url": "https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/chinese-tourists-biggest-spenders-in-singapore-report-4707710.html?vn_source=Folder&vn_campaign=Stream&vn_medium=Item-66&vn_term=Desktop", "title": "Chinese tourists biggest spenders in Singapore: report", "content": "Chinese tourists spent a total S$2.3 billion (US$1.7 billion) while traveling in Singapore last year, making them the biggest spender in the city state.

Under the leadership of the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS) of Tay Ninh Province, the Consecration Ceremony of the Maitreya Bodhisattva statue on the top of Ba Den Mountain was held with great solemnity Jan. 28, including sacred rituals such as chanting prayers, purification ceremonies, and recitation of blessings. Located at an altitude of 900m on the peak of Ba Den Mountain, the giant Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue stands 36 meters tall, with a maximum width of 45 meters and a surface area of 4,651 square meters. This sculpture, weighing 5,112 tons, is a unique creation in Vietnam, composed of 6,688 natural sapphire stones assembled to resemble terraced fields. Each sapphire stone was carefully selected for color, veining, and precise dimensions before being sculpted according to the design template. The emotional speech at the ceremony by Venerable Elder Vien Minh, Deputy Dharma Master of the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha, said that the Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue symbolizes the virtues of compassion and generosity and is the future Buddha, representing the prosperity and peace of our country's future. \"I am delighted and commend the merit of Sun Group, its leaders, and all employees who have wholeheartedly built a beautiful tourist area, enriching the spiritual life, promoting the beauty of Vietnam, and contributing to the prosperity of the Vietnamese economy,\" he said. The most touching moment of the ceremony was when over 20,000 lanterns, inscribed with prayers by Buddhist followers, locals, and tourists, were lit, creating a magical and sacred space. Each lit candle carries the wishes of tranquility and prosperity from Buddhist followers, tourists, and locals. The entire square space under the foot of the Tay Bo Da Son Buddha at Ba Den Mountain was illuminated during the lantern offering ceremony, creating a grand lantern festival. \"Although I have been to Ba Den Mountain twice, this is the first time I have participated in such a large-scale lantern offering ceremony. Especially since this is the first time, I have seen the Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue, made of the largest jade stone in the world, I feel even more touched and fortunate. Being able to come to pay homage to the compassionate Western Bodhisattva, I also feel serene, compassionate, and forget about everyday worries, feeling happier,\" said Ngo Bich Lien from Can Tho. The addition of the Wishing Bridge, a 90-meter-long crescent-shaped bridge, provides a symbolic and visually stunning experience for pilgrims and tourists. The Wishing Bridge, adorned with golden metallic tiles depicting cloud patterns, symbolizes prosperity and tranquility, enhancing the spiritual journey to the Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue. Serving as a bridge to the statue and offering panoramic views of the vast plains and Dau Tieng Lake, the Wishing Bridge enriches the overall experience of the pilgrimage. Nestled behind and surrounding the Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue is a colossal, 35-meter-high artificial waterfall, creating a dazzling and enchanting scene atop Ba Den Mountain. The world-renowned Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue, crafted from top-quality granite, stands at the center, while the waterfall is complemented by a modern fountain system, a first-of-its-kind technology in Vietnam, and an array of impressive lights and culturally rich dance performances by actors. Together, they form a grand and artistically rich water music show, reflecting the spiritual and cultural essence of the region. The Consecration Ceremony of the Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue, along with the appearance of the Wishing Bridge and the grand and impressive water music show, have contributed to the completion of the spiritual and cultural complex on top of Ba Den Mountain. At the ceremony, Vo Duc Trong, Permanent Vice Chairman of the People's Committee of Tay Ninh Province, said that with the contribution of Sun Group, Ba Den National Tourist Area has been thoroughly invested with many internationally renowned works such as the highest statue of Tay Bo Da Son Buddha on the mountain peak, the largest cable car station in the world, and a Buddhist exhibition center applying the world's leading advanced technologies. \"Today, with the Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue made of the world's top large sapphire stone, created in a special method never seen before in Vietnam, Sun Group has created a new symbol of a new stature for Tay Ninh tourism,\" he said.

Speaking after welcoming Loong Air's inaugural flight from China's Hangzhou at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) on Feb. 2, the official said that Malaysia is encouraging more charter flights from China to implement the initiative and leveraging with travel agents and airlines to increase the frequency of flights from maybe twice a week to the target of four flights a week. He said the target is also in line with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China this year, in addition to boosting tourism efforts for Visit Malaysia Year 2026. He was also optimistic that Tourism Malaysia can reach the target of between 5 million and 7 million Chinese tourists for this year, which means a five-fold increase on last year\u2019s Chinese arrivals, in line with the 30-day visa exemption initiative for Chinese and Indian tourists which started on Dec. 1, 2023.

His love for Vietnam began in March 2018 when the 25-year-old Japanese man traveled abroad for the first time. On his first day in Ho Chi Minh City, Keiichi was \"captivated\" by the banh mi. Sweet and sour chili sauce, grilled meat sandwiches, and pate spread served with pickles made it possible for him to eat three loaves a day without getting bored. \"In the following days, I tried more types of Hoi An bread, milk bread, and pillow bread. Every type was delicious despite the different sweet and salty flavors,\" he said. Because there was not much time on that trip, Keiichi regretted that he did not have the chance to try enough other dishes. However, when he boarded the plane to return home, the young man still tried to carry a few more loaves of bread. Returning home, he looked for places that sold Vietnamese bread and he had tried more than 20 stores but he did not find the true Vietnamese flavor. Three months later, he bought a ticket back to Vietnam. This time he decided to travel alone from the south to north for a month to fulfill his wish of \"eating authentic Vietnamese food,\" focusing on typical dishes from each region such as noodle soup, mixed rice paper, crab soup or pho, snail vermicelli and draft beer. \"Some days I ate 6-7 meals. I enjoyed banh cuon (steamed rice rolls) and drank more than six cans of Hanoi beer. I still didn't get bored eating three or four cups of sweet soup che at once,\" he said. Keiichi said pungent dishes like bun dau mam tom (vermicelli with tofu and fermented shrimp paste) and durian made him almost vomit the first time he ate them, but now he was addicted to them. \"Now I always eat one durian every month. I can't stand it if I don't eat it,\" he said. \"I really missed Vietnam every time I had to leave this place. Sometimes when I return to Japan for a few days, I only wanted to buy a ticket to return to Vietnam. I love the way Vietnamese people are close and support each other,\" Keiichi said. Keiichi said he just celebrated the New Year holiday in Vietnam instead of returning to his hometown to reunite with his family. The sight of people gathering in the city center to watch music events and fireworks together made him feel like the city was all one big, happy, warm family. \"I've been in Vietnam for four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter but have never celebrated traditional Tet. This year I will stay here to celebrate Tet,\" he said. The young man admitted that he was a little worried when he heard that during the Lunar New Year, people rest and close their shops to return to their hometowns to be with their families. However, he plans to join Tet activities such as wrapping banh chung (square sticky rice cake), eating meat and pickled onions, and watching traditional festivals, things that only take place during Tet. \"Maybe I will ask to celebrate Tet at the house of some close Vietnamese friends.

A special highlight lies in the final performance, \"Hello Vietnam,\" with new harmonies using the flute, and gourd and drums.

As the Lunar New Year approaches, Vietnamese households bustle with excitement and anticipation, preparing for one of the most significant and cherished celebrations of the year. Join us on a culinary journey as we explore the 10 common dishes that adorn the Lunar New Year food tray in Vietnam. 1. Banh chung/banh tet (sticky rice cakes) Banh chung, a square rice cake, is commonly enjoyed savory in northern Vietnam, while banh tet, a cylindrical sticky rice cake and a specialty of central and southern region, can be found in both savory and sweet variations. The main ingredients of both these cakes often include glutinous rice, mung beans, pork belly, and a blend of spices such as salt, pepper, green onions, and fish sauce. These ingredients are layered, wrapped in banana leaves, and boiled or steamed until cooked through. Legend has it that banh chung was created by a Vietnamese prince, Lang Lieu, as a symbol of respect for ancestors, representing the Earth through its ingredients sourced directly from the land. The origins of banh tet are believed to trace back to the Cham people, with the cake likely evolving through a combination of exchanging culinary practices and sharing cultural traditions between the two communities. Another account of banh tet's origin tells of a moment during King Quang Trung's rule in 1789. In the midst of a battle against invaders, a soldier offered the king a cake as a symbol of goodwill. Moved by the gesture, King Quang Trung declared that the cake should be enjoyed during Tet, hence naming it Tet cake, or banh tet. Banh chung and banh tet typically feature soft and slightly sticky glutinous rice complemented by a subtle herbal aroma infused by the banana leaves. The mung beans and pork contribute to a savory flavor profile, characterized by a combination of fatty and nutty notes. 2. Boiled chicken Boiled chicken, a dish originating from Chinese cuisine, holds a significant place in Lunar New Year celebrations across Vietnam. In Vietnamese culture, roosters are traditionally favored over hens in New Year offerings. The rooster symbolizes new beginnings and the start of favorable conditions for agriculture. During Lunar New Year's Eve worship, offerings of sticky rice and boiled chicken are made, symbolizing hopes for prosperity and success in the upcoming year. The chicken is boiled until shiny and golden, infused with aromatic flavors of ginger. Accompanied by a salt and lime dip, it's served alongside sticky rice. In Hanoi, leftover Tet ingredients, like boiled chicken, are often repurposed to prepare delicacies such as bun thang (shredded chicken noodle soup). 3. Gio lua/gio xao (Pork roll/ pork ear roll) Pork roll, known as cha lua in the central and southern regions and gio lua in the north, is a pork delicacy commonly found in the food tray during Lunar New Year. Meanwhile, pork ear roll is a dish often enjoyed during Tet celebrations in northern Vietnam. Pork roll is prepared by pounding the meat into a thick paste and seasoning it with various spices, starchy flour, and fish sauce. Afterward, it\u2019s wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. The result is a pork sausage characterized by a tender texture and a subtle pink hue, accompanied by a fragrance infused by the banana leaves. Known by two names gio xao (stir-fried pork roll) and gio thu (pork head roll), pork ear roll made from thinly sliced pork head meat, primarily ears and cheeks. Marinated with fish sauce and pepper, it's stir-fried with wood ear mushrooms until firm and golden. Wrapped in banana leaves and cooled to set, it offers a blend of textures and flavors - crunchy ear and cheek, fragrant fish sauce and spicy pepper, with a hint of subtle banana leaf aroma. In addition to its role in Tet celebrations, both pork roll and pork ear roll are enjoyed year-round as a complement to everyday dishes. 4. Xoi gac (red sticky rice) In Eastern culture, the color red represents happiness, luck, and goodness. During special occasions like Tet and ancestral ceremonies, people prepare a dish called red sticky rice. This dish is made by mixing sticky rice with gac fruit (sweet gourd). The rice is cooked until it's soft and fragrant. The result is red sticky rice, believed to symbolize prosperity and good fortune. Depending on where you are in Vietnam, some people like to add shredded coconut or coconut milk in the south, while others in the north might include green beans or sprinkle sugar on top. Despite its subtle sweetness, xoi gac is commonly paired with savory dishes such as pork floss and pork roll. 5. Spring rolls Spring rolls are known as cha gio in the south or nem ran in the north. Filled with a savory mixture of pork, shrimp, carrots, wood ear mushrooms, glass noodles, and bean sprouts, then wrapped in rice paper. The rolls are fried to perfection, resulting in a golden hue and a crispy exterior. The northern rendition of spring rolls typically features more vegetables encased in a thin rice paper skin, whereas the southern variation has a thicker outer layer with a heartier meat filling, often complemented by shredded taro. The origin of spring rolls is still a bit unclear, but there are a few ideas about where they came from. Many believe that they've been around in Vietnamese cooking for a long time. People up in northern Vietnam might have come up with them as an easy-to-eat dish that lasts a while, especially during wartime. Another prevalent theory suggests that spring rolls may have been influenced by similar dishes in Chinese cuisine. As part of cultural exchange, this dish likely made its way into Vietnamese culinary practices, where it was adapted to local tastes. The result is a dish that reflects the fusion of cultural influences in Vietnamese cuisine. These fried delights are often served alongside herbs and a sweet-sour fish sauce. Typically served as an appetizer, they can also be enjoyed with vermicelli or rice. 6. Braised pork with duck eggs Braised pork with duck eggs is a Tet dish widely enjoyed in southern and central regions. Prepared with pork belly, garlic, shallots, soy sauce, sugar, and fish sauce, braised pork is simmered in a blend of coconut water, garlic, and shallots. Slow-cooked alongside duck eggs until tender, it's commonly served alongside rice or pickled mustard greens. In a pot of braised pork with duck eggs, the juxtaposition of square meat pieces and round eggs symbolizes harmony and balance, reflecting the concept of yin and yang. The round eggs, representing fertility, symbolize wishes for a joyful New Year and a family blessed with abundance. 7. Stuffed bitter melon soup Canh kho qua, or stuffed bitter melon soup, is another dish enjoyed during Lunar New Year in southern regions of Vietnam. It's made by filling bitter melons with a mixture of ground pork, fish, mushrooms, and spices, then simmering them in broth until tender. The name kho qua, or bitter melon, explains the wish for all kho, sorrows and misfortunes of the old year, to qua - pass, to receive good news in the new year. This dish is not only symbolic but also offers numerous health benefits. Stuffed bitter melon is known for its cooling properties and high fiber. During Tet, the weather in southern Vietnam can be quite hot. Enjoying a bowl of stuffed bitter melon soup provides a refreshing respite from the heat, offering a cooling effect and balancing out the richness of other festive dishes. 8. Jellied pork Jellied pork is a popular dish in northern Vietnam, especially during the colder months and Lunar New Year celebrations. Made from pork leg and stir-fried pork skin with mushrooms, it's served cold and develops a jelly-like texture due to the collagen in the pig's skin. It is said that this dish started when stewed pork leg soup was left out in the cold and accidentally froze, turning into a special treat. Now, every Tet, families in the north make this dish to enjoy during the holiday. Jellied pork is perfect for eating cold, making it easy to store in cold weather or fridges without needing to heat it up again. It is often served with a side of spicy fish sauce to enhance its flavor. 9. Bamboo shoot soup If stuffed bitter melon soup reigns supreme during Tet feasts in the southern regions, then bamboo shoot soup serves as its counterpart in the north. The soup symbolizes warmth and togetherness during the festive season. In addition to its cultural importance, bamboo shoot soup is valued for its nutritional benefits, rich in vitamins and fiber. The soup is made with a variety of bamboo shoots including fresh bamboo and dried bamboo shoots. The dried bamboo shoots are soaked in water at least three times to reduce their strong odor. The soup is slow-cooked with pork knuckles to create a rich broth. 10. Dua hanh and cu kieu (pickled leeks and shallots) Pickle dishes like dua hanh (pickled shallots) and cu kieu (pickled leeks) are commonly found on festive menus. Pickled shallots are a favorite in northern regions, whereas pickled leeks are preferred in the south. Their mildly sour, slightly spicy, and aromatic flavors serve to offset the richness of dishes such as braised pork and sticky rice cakes. According to ancient beliefs, the inclusion of shallots and onions during Tet signifies wealth and prosperity.", "date": "2024-02-15 23:53:18"}, {"url": "https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/hcmc-pilots-use-of-electric-cars-to-serve-tourists-4707202.html?vn_source=Folder&vn_campaign=Stream&vn_medium=Item-72&vn_term=Desktop", "title": "HCMC pilots use of electric cars to serve tourists", "content": "Ho Chi Minh City is planning to use some 200 electric cars to transport tourists around downtown.
